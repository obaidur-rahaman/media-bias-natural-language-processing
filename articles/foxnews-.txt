close video susan rice email about oval office meeting released should james comey answer additional questions on capitol hill? former prosecutor jonna spilbor weighs in on 'fox & friends first.' “don’t let up,” a friend living abroad wrote a few weeks ago about corruption at the fbi. “trump has them all on the run.” the note came to mind when i saw the weird e-mail susan rice wrote to herself on inauguration day last year. at first glance, the e-mail, which purports to recount remarks president obama made two weeks earlier to rice, fbi head james comey and others about the russia probe, makes no sense. but ask yourself why rice repeated that obama wanted everything done “by the book,” and it smells as if she’s preparing a last-minute defense for obama, and maybe herself. senators chuck grassley and lindsey graham, pit bulls on government misbehavior, wrote to rice about the e-mail while noting that there were lots of doubts about whether the fbi actually did proceed “by the book.” hopefully, she’ll have to give her answer under oath, as should comey and anybody else in the room. to continue reading michael goodwin's column from the new york post, click here. michael goodwin is a fox news contributor and new york post columnist.

treasury secretary steven mnuchin announced plans to eliminate hundreds of tax regulations.  (ap) the treasury department plans to eliminate nearly 300 outdated tax regulations, getting tax rules off the books that in some cases have not applied since the 1940s. the department announced its proposal to eliminate unnecessary tax regulations this week, in compliance with two executive orders signed by president donald trump last year to reduce regulatory burdens and simplify the tax code. "we continue our work to ensure that our tax regulatory system promotes economic growth," said secretary steven mnuchin. "these 298 regulations serve no useful purpose to taxpayers and we have proposed eliminating them." "i look forward to continuing to build on our efforts to make the regulatory system more efficient and effective," he said. executive order 13789, signed last april, instructs the treasury to "bring clarity" to the tax code and identify all tax regulations that "impose an undue financial burden on united states taxpayers," "add undue complexity to the federal tax laws," or "exceed the statutory authority of the internal revenue service." the department's latest action addresses the complexity of the tax code. the proposed rule would remove tax regulations that have already been repealed; repeal regulations that have been significantly changed from their original purpose; and repeal regulations that are no longer applicable. click for more from the washington free beacon.
