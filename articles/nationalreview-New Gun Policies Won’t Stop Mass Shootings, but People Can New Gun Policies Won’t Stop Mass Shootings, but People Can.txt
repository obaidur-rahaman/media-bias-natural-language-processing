gladwell argues that each new shooting lowers the threshold for the shooters to come. each new shooting makes it easier for the next shooter to pick up his gun. others have used the term “contagion” to describe the wave of copycat killers. again, each killing inspires the next, and as the killings increase so does the inspiration. we can’t deflect responsibility upwards, to washington. we’re still the first line of defense in our own communities. what does this mean? it means that americans need to be aware that this contagion exists, that this “ever-evolving riot” is under way. we can’t deflect responsibility upwards, to washington. we’re still the first line of defense in our own communities. we cannot simply assume that the kid filling his social-media feed with menacing pictures is just in “a phase” or that strange obsessions with murder or mass death are morbid, but harmless. we’ve trained ourselves to mind our own business, to delegate interventions to professionals, and to “judge not” the actions of others. but in a real way, we are our brother’s keeper; and an ethic of “see something, say something” is a vital part of community life. instead, we all too often retreat into our lives — either afraid that intervention carries risks or falsely comforted by the belief that surely someone else will do the right thing. we’ve seen this dynamic in other crimes. the worst of the sexual predators revealed (so far) by the #metoo movement, harvey weinstein and larry nassar, could have been stopped so much earlier if the people around them had shown just an ounce more courage in the face of known complaints and known misconduct. we didn’t need better laws to stop rape. we needed better people. one of the greatest challenges for any society is stopping a man who is determined to commit murder, and we’ll never fully succeed. even the most vigilant community will still suffer at the hands of evil men. but it’s days like these, when children lay dead in school, that we must remind ourselves that we’re all in this together. we have responsibilities, not just to mourn and comfort the families of the lost, but to think carefully about our own communities and the circle of people in our lives — and to take action to guard our own children and our own schools. it is the duty of a free people to be aware, to have courage, and to care for one another. for me, that’s a reminder that i can’t consider a troubled person someone else’s problem. i can’t assume it won’t happen in my school or in my town. rather than tweet impotently, i’ve armed myself to protect my family and my neighbors; in my past role as a member of a school board, i’ve worked to better secure my kids’ school; and i’ve vowed that if — god forbid — i ever see evidence or warning signs of the darkness of a killer’s heart, i’ll have the courage to seek the intervention that can save lives. that’s not public policy. it’s personal responsibility. it’s also the best way to confine the contagion that’s killing our kids. — david french is a senior writer for national review, a senior fellow at the national review institute, and an attorney.
