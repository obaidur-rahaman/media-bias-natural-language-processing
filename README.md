# Media-bias-natural-language-processing

## Overview

Media can be biased in various ways. In this work we have explored political bias of the news media as available on public websites. News articles were scraped from various left and right biased websites. Then the articles were clustered based on the similarities between them.  

## Data

The text data were scraped from the following USA based websites:

Conservative/right biased:

1. http://www.foxnews.com/politics.html
2. http://www.nationalreview.com 
3. https://www.newsmax.com
4. https://townhall.com

Liberal/left biased

1. https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics
2. https://www.theatlantic.com/most-popular
3. https://washingtonmonthly.com/politics
4. https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics

## Repository structure

articles: stores all the news articles
